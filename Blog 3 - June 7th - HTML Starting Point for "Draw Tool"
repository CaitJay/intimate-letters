 
<!-- writing a canvas web app for drawing -->

<!-- 1. need an element and an id

2. need a script to connect to JS

3. need a function for mouse movement -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> 
    
    <!--why does it need lang="en"? Can it just be <html> on its own? -->
    
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"> 
    
    <!--UTF= Unicode Transformation Format, is part of the Unicode Standard? 

Unicode = a set of characters with unique decimal numbers. 

Encoding = how numbers are translated into binary numbers.

Default for HTML5 is UTF-8, it is encoding.

Encoding must be declared using a <meta> element.

It needs a <charset> attribute. It must be inside the <head>

What is a meta element? 
It is saying, "some info about this document". Not always a part of document but could be about it. 

What is a charset attribute?
Specifies character encodig for the document.

Does it need a viewport element?

What does it do? 
I think it helps the text render on the screen...

<canvas id is needed because I'm drawing graphics using JS.
the <canvas> tag is a container for the graphics but need the <script> tag for JS to draw the graphics.

Need to specify attributes with height and width? -->
    
     <canvas id="My Canvas" width="400" height="300" style="boder: 2px solid black"></canvas>
      
    <title>DrawingWords</title>
    <style>
    /* what goes in here? 
        use this space for colours and fonts (elements of html in a browser) - for CSS */
        
        
    </style>
    
    </head>
    
   <body>
    <!-- need to draw a box where the mouse can "write" inside"-->
       
       <div id="box"></div>

    
    </body> 
    



</html>
