/* the function is ev_mousemove? and false is the event?

false means cancelable? 
is this polling? 
want to give the code a chance to react to the event as it occurs?
So mousemove is an event handler?

false is the boolean value */

function ev_mousemove (ev){

/* var can't be x because x is used as a mouse position with y later on. 

what is ev? Event? Part of Drag and Drop?

when you use an event on an element, the debugger tool places "ev" there to let you know that an event is attached? It has an event listener. 


/* add in "if, else" to assign positions to x and y for the mouse?
*/

if (ev.layerX) || ev.layerX==0){
    x = ev.layerX;
    y = ev.layerY;    
}

/* what is ev.layerX? 
it should add the event objects to be used in drawing canvas - plotting coordinates relative to the canvas as vertical and horizontal for the mouse cursor

so, ev.layerX is specific to a certain brwoser and offsetX is for another browser

this line - (ev.layerX) || ev.layerX==0) is saying that the condition, ev.layerX, is false if it doesnt exist for the browser or does exist with value 0 

this is a command to make sure the code wors in the browser

should work for Firefox and Chrome */
