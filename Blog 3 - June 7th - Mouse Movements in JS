/* Need to introduce mouse movements, like up, down, move...
this should happen in addEventListener */

function initialise (){
    
 var canvas=document.getElementById("canvas_1"); 
 canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', ev_mousemove, false); 
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', ev_canvas, false);
}

/* canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', ev_canvas, false); - why does it use ev_canvas instead of ev_mousemove? 

ev_canvas is a function that invokes the mousedown method of the tool object. 
Where is the tool object?

does - tool.mousedown = function (ev) {} - solve the issue?

need to use the tool in the tool_pencil function?

Why is it still false?
