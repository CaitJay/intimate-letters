/* what does the "!" mean? 
It inverts a boolean expression, which means, if something is true, the function calling it would be false*/

/* context.beginPath(); - it clears the current internal path and all sub-paths.
It tells canvas to draw a new path. Without it, all drawings will merge together instead of staying separate. 
the "()" can stay empty because it doesn't require any parameters. 

What is a path?
It is a sequence of lines. You can't give it values but can make a sequence of method calls to describe its shape. 
*/

/* context.moveTo(x, y); -  this starts a new path. A path needs to be closed before it can be filled. */

what is "started = true;"? Wasn't started = false before?

Is this because they are both booleans? and they both need to be stated to be used?
