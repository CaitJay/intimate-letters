digital letter writing from a distance


//I am exploring how to send info from a physical and handwritten artifact (a letter) to the web for digital archival. 
Does this entail a photographing a handwritten letter and sending a picture to an online space? Can the elements of the handwriting be broken down into smaller components and replicated? How does a camera determine different aspects of the handwriting?

//What is the difference between a thin line and a thick line? 
//How would a line be broken down compared to a dot? 
//How does a computer understand 
one compared to the other and what info does it get from both items? 

//what is a line? 
// How do I make a single line appear in html?
// How do I make a dot appear in html?
To Explore Later:

//tracking.js libraries that use colour tracking algorithms? 
//it seems like they need an if and then statement 
//the colour being detected would need to be identified? 
//assuming the colour is black, for a black pen, can you just write black or do you pull "black" from another library?


Test 1 for “boxed” 

//found the first line but I don't understand what "boxed" means. Content inside the div doesn't seem to be any different than adding the content to the body.
<div class="boxed">
  Test for boxed.
</div>

Test 2 for border-top

 <div.content {
  border-top: 1px solid black;
}></div.content>

//does it not work because I have to declare a variable first? Does border-top need to be defined? 
//can <div></div> function alone?
//yes - because it works with this -> <div id="awesome">sauce</div> //declares sauce

Test 3 for <hr>

   <hr width="200" align="left">

//200= what? 
//Align = left of the page? 
//can I declare a colour?
