//declare function first?

function NameMe(){

var x = document.getElementById("DrawText"); //call this first to access drawing context in next line
    //w3 example has var ctx. What is that?
    var img = document.getElementById("handwriting")//img id goes here
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); //do I put x where canvas is? 
ctx.drawImage(img, 90, 130, 50, 60, 10, 10, 50, 60); // (img, x, y) x=width?, y=height?, img is calling the image?
}; 

//ctx is short for context - is only used as a name for a variable. can name it anything.



//my canvas id needs to be put into var x () ? 


//the default size of the canvas is width = 300 px and height = 150 px? But can be readjusted?
//context object is used to draw graphics on the canvas
//what is the canvas?

//canvas is an element in Webkit that draws 2D graphics?
//only two attributes to canvas - width and height 



//function () {
//var img = document.querySelector('#step2 img');
//need to set up canvas so js can type out text from image?
//need to draw text using canvas 

//How to use this? -> <script src="ocrad.js"></script> <input type="file" accept="image/*">
