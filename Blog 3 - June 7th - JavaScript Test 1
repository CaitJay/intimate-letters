/* I found a a way to draw using the mouse but I don't understand what any of it means. In this file I'm going to break down each line until I've figured it out*/


function initialise (){
    
 var canvas=document.getElementById("canvas_1"); 
 canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', ev_mousemove, false); 
}

/*how are these two lines different?
what is "addEventListener"?
What is the "false" for?


canvas is the object.

addEventListener - attaches an event to an element

In order to attach something, it's asking that if the mouse moves the output will be whatever is stated in the getElementById. 

ev means event? 
Mouse Events - is onmousemove the same as ev_mousemove?

so, can I use this?
<div onmouseenter="myEnterFunction()">
  <p>onmouseenter: <br> <span id="demo2">Mouse over me!</span></p>
</div>

/* To Do Later - break down by mouse movements - up, down right, left, horizontal?, circle?
*/

/* want to add in a "save" button and a "clear" button. Possibly a "preview button? */

/* add a function for mouse clicking and moving, not just moving across page to create drawing*/
